It was on a night like this that Santa did not arrive. The weather had been crazy. We have been experiencing warm spring like temperatures for most of December and now it was impossible for the reindeer to reach us.

Maybe next year we will be luckier. I think perhaps Santa ought to think about getting in touch with Amazon.
