It was on a night like this that Santa did not arrive. The weather has been very unusual. We have been experiencing warm spring like temperatures for most of December and now it was impossible for the reindeer to reach us.

Maybe next year we will be luckier. I think perhaps Santa ought to think about getting in touch with Amazon.

Amazon appear to be very serious about this. I for one think for the moment this is nothing more than a publicity stunt. What do you think? Can you see any potential problems with drone deliveries?
