It was on a night like this that Santa did not arrive. The weather has been very unusual. We have been experiencing warm spring like temperatures for most of December and now it was impossible for the reindeer to reach us.

Maybe next year we will be luckier. Perhaps Santa should talk to Amazon.

Amazon appear to have found a way of dispensing with the need for reindeer. I think for the moment this is nothing more than a publicity stunt. What do you think? Can you see any potential problems with drone deliveries, apart from delinquent reindeer threatening the security of our northern cities?
